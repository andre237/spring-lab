# Lab project for Spring features training <img height="65" width="130" src="https://bgasparotto.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/spring-boot-logo.png" align="left"/>
<br/>

This project aims to provide a training environment about Spring Boot features and external tools, well-known in the web-backend area. 
I'll be focusing on micro-service architectures by using HTTP communication (Open Feign) and message queues (Apache Kafka), as well as SQL(MongoDB) and noSQL(PostgreSQL) data layers.
In the near future, I hope to learn more about Elastic Search and implement it here in the project
